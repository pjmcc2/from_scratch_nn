# A Simple MLP for classification of the iris dataset from "scratch"

I used numpy and autograd. I spent a lot of time trying to get the derivatives done manually, included using the wonderful [site linked here](https://www.matrixcalculus.org/matrixCalculus)
for checking my work. However, I still could not get the network to converge! I tried a few tricks to avoid vanishing/exploding gradient, but still to no avail.
If you think using autograd is cheating...well too bad. When am I ever going to write "by hand" the derivative of an arbitrarily deep network? Boo hoo. 


I doubt anyone will use this, but I tried to make it at least somewhat legible. Enjoy.
