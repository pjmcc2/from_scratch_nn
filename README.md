# A Simple MLP for classification of the iris dataset from "scratch"

I used numpy and autograd. I spent a lot of time trying to get the derivatives done manually, included using the wonderful [site linked here](https://www.matrixcalculus.org/matrixCalculus)
for checking my work. However, I still could not get the network to converge! I tried a few tricks to avoid vanishing/exploding gradient, but still to no avail.


If you end up playing with this, I hope you enjoy! I had a lot of fun (and frustation) making this.
